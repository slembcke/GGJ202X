# Slapstick NES

A 2 player NES Slapstick game about pratfalls, banana peels, and mallets!

As your final task to graduate from clown school, you must make the head clown laugh. You know your craft. You can do this!

# Emulation

Since this is a NES game, you'll probably need an emulator (or flash cart) to play it.
For Windows and Linux we'd recommend Mesen as a good modern NES emulator: https://mesen.ca/
For Mac, Nestopia is quite nice: https://www.bannister.org/software/nestopia.htm
